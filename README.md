# Mobile_DNA_BS4_WebScrape

This web scraper is a work in progress application I built based on DS 636 at NJIT. It is a pinnacle of Data Science enviroment being used in R. This is a small project that will gather and perform an analysis on titles using Natural Language Processing.


## Edit 12/29/2023

Adjusted querying parameters for the console application. Now it queries correctly using topic, and year before the application was not doing it correctly only depending on topic which provided incorrect results.
